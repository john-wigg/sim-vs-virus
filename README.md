# sim-vs-virus

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is spreading through the world, scientists advise to #stayathome, and governments increasingly impose restrictions on freedom of movement. But why should I care?

This project is a small, interactive web app. You can choose different role models for your live. Do I wash my hands? Do I go outside? How often do I go outside? Do I practise social distancing? Then let the simulation play out!

The project resulted from the hackathon #WirVsVirusHack, organized by the German Federal Government. The corresponding devpost page can be found here: https://devpost.com/software/sim-vs-virus
